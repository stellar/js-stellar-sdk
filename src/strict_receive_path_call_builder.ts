/**
 * The Stellar Network allows payments to be made across assets through path
 * payments. A strict receive path payment specifies a series of assets to route
 * a payment through, from source asset (the asset debited from the payer) to
 * destination asset (the asset credited to the payee).
 *
 * A path search is specified using:
 *
 * * The source address or source assets.
 * * The asset and amount that the destination account should receive
 *
 * As part of the search, horizon will load a list of assets available to the
 * source address and will find any payment paths from those source assets to
 * the desired destination asset. The search's amount parameter will be used to
 * determine if there a given path can satisfy a payment of the desired amount.
 *
 * If a list of assets is passed as the source, horizon will find any payment
 * paths from those source assets to the desired destination asset.
 *
 * Do not create this object directly, use {@link Server#strictReceivePaths}.
 * @see [Find Payment Paths](https://developers.stellar.org/api/aggregations/paths/)
 * @extends CallBuilder
 * @param {string|URL} serverUrl Horizon server URL.
 * @param {string|Asset[]} source The sender's account ID or a list of Assets. Any returned path must use a source that the sender can hold.
 * @param {Asset} destinationAsset The destination asset.
 * @param {string} destinationAmount The amount, denominated in the destination asset, that any returned path should be able to satisfy.
