/**
 * A minimal implementation of Rust's `Result` type. Used for contract
 * methods that return Results, to maintain their distinction from methods
 * that simply either return a value or throw.
 *
 * #### Why is this needed?
 *
 * This is used by {@link module:contract.Spec | `ContractSpec`} and
 * {@link module:contract.AssembledTransaction | `AssembledTransaction`} when
 * parsing values return by contracts.
 *
 * Contract methods can be implemented to return simple values, in which case
 * they can also throw errors. This matches JavaScript's most idiomatic
 * workflow, using `try...catch` blocks.
 *
 * But Rust also gives the flexibility of returning `Result` types. And Soroban
 * contracts further support this with the `#[contracterror]` macro. Should
 * JavaScript calls to such methods ignore all of that, and just flatten this
 * extra info down to the same `try...catch` flow as other methods? We're not
 * sure.
 *
 * For now, we've added this minimal implementation of Rust's `Result` logic,
 * which exports the `Result` interface and its associated implementations,
 * `Ok` and `Err`. This allows `ContractSpec` and `AssembledTransaction` to
 * work together to duplicate the contract's Rust logic, always returning
 * `Result` types for contract methods that are implemented to do so.
 *
 * In the future, if this feels too un-idiomatic for JavaScript, we can always
 * remove this and flatten all JS calls to `try...catch`. Easier to remove this
 * logic later than it would be to add it.
